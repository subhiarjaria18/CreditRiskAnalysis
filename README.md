# CreditRiskAnalysis

##Description
Welcome to the Credit Risk Analysis project repository! In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of credit risk assessment using machine learning techniques. Our goal is to determine whether a user deserves a credit card based on their profile information. This is a crucial task in the banking sector, where accurate risk assessment is paramount for maintaining financial stability.

##Key Features
Feature Engineering: We employ advanced feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful insights from the data.
Data Encoding: Utilizing both one-hot encoding and label encoding methods to preprocess categorical variables from the CIBIL dataset and user dataset.
Classification Problem: The task at hand is framed as a classification problem, where we predict whether a user qualifies for a credit card or not.
Algorithm Selection: We experiment with various classification algorithms including Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Random Forest. Among these, XGBoost demonstrates superior performance.
Model Fine-tuning: We meticulously fine-tune the XGBoost model to enhance its accuracy, ensuring robust predictions.
Validation on Unseen Data: The effectiveness of our model is evaluated on unseen datasets to validate its performance in real-world scenarios.
Technicalities in Banking Sector
In the banking sector, credit risk analysis plays a pivotal role in assessing the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their financial obligations. This involves analyzing various factors such as credit history, income stability, debt-to-income ratio, and other socio-economic indicators. Machine learning algorithms offer a powerful toolset to automate and optimize this process, enabling banks to make more informed lending decisions.
